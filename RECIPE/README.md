## RECIPE : Converting Concurrent DRAM Indexes to Persistent-Memory Indexes (SOSP 2019)

RECIPE proposes a principled approach for converting concurrent indexes built for DRAM into crash-consistent indexes for persistent memory. This repository includes the implementations of the index structures for persistent memory converted from the existing concurrent DRAM indexes by following RECIPE. For performance evaluations, this repository also provides the microbenchmarks for index structures based on YCSB. This repository contains all the information needed to reproduce the main results from our paper.

Please cite the following paper if you use the RECIPE approach or RECIPE-converted indexes:

## Integrating RECIPE indexes into your own project

Apart from benchmark code with `ycsb.cpp`, we provide simple example codes (`P-*/example.cpp` for each RECIPE index) 
to help developers who want to apply RECIPE indexes into their own project to easily identify how to use each index's APIs. 
These example source codes run insert and lookup operations with custom integer keys. For more details of usage for each index, 
please refer to `P-*/README.md` in each index's directory and `ycsb.cpp` as well.

## Important Limitation

#### Persistent memory allocator
The RECIPE data structures in the master branch use a volatile memory allocator ([libvmmalloc](http://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.3/libvmmalloc.3.html)) 
so that RECIPE can be compared in an apples-to-apples manner with prior work like FAST&FAIR and 
CCEH, which also use volatile allocators (and thereby do not provide crash consistency). Thus, 
if you use RECIPE data structures from the master branch on PM, metadata related to memory allocator 
will **not** have crash consistency.

The current volatile allocator must be replaced with persistent memory allocator to ensure crash 
consistency of memory allocator and to prevent permanent memory leaks. Especially, we recommend
post-crash garbage collection rather than logging-based approaches to solve permanent memory leaks
since logging-based approaches should constantly consume costs for recording logs during normal 
runtime (We already described it through our SOSP publication). We are currently exploring various 
post-crash garbage collection techniques ([[1]](#1), [[2]](#2), [[3]](#3), [[4]](#4), [[5]](#5)) to 
apply them for RECIPE data structures.

As a first step, we are working on replacing current volatile allocator with [PMDK](https://pmem.io/pmdk/) library and on
solving permanent memory leaks using the functions provided by it [[5]](#5). Please check out
the `pmdk` branch for the updates of this work as well as these [details](pmdk.md).

### Recommended use cases for RECIPE indexes

1. `P-CLHT` is a good fit for applications requiring high-performance point queries.
2. `P-HOT` is a good fit for  applications with read-dominated workloads.
3. `P-BwTree` provides well-balanced performance for insertion, lookup, and range scan operations for applications using integer keys.
4. `P-ART` is suitable for  applications with insertion-dominated workloads and a small number of range queries.
5. `P-Masstree` provides well-balanced performance for insertion, lookup, and range scan operations for applications using either integer or string keys.

## Running RECIPE Indexes on Persistent Memory and DRAM

### Desired system configurations (for DRAM environment)
- Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS
- At least 32GB DRAM
- x86-64 CPU supporting at least 16 threads
- P-HOT: x86-64 CPU supporting at least the AVX-2 and BMI-2 instruction sets (Haswell and newer)
- Compile: cmake, g++-7, gcc-7, c++17

### Dependencies
#### Install build packages
```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libboost-all-dev libpapi-dev default-jdk
```
#### Install jemalloc and tbb
```
$ sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev libjemalloc-dev
```
### Generating YCSB workloads
#### Download YCSB source code
```
$ cd ./index-microbench
$ curl -O --location https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/download/0.11.0/ycsb-0.11.0.tar.gz
$ tar xfvz ycsb-0.11.0.tar.gz
$ mv ycsb-0.11.0 YCSB
```
#### How to configure and generate workloads
Configure the options of each workloads (a, b, c, e), would only need to change `$recordcount` and `$operationcount`.
```
$ vi ./index-microbench/workload_spec/<workloada or workloadb or workloadc or workloade>
```
Select which workloads to be generated. Default configuration will generate all workloads (a, b, c, e). Change the code line `for WORKLOAD_TYPE in <a b c e>; do`, depending on which workload you want to generate.
```
$ vi ./index-microbench/generate_all_workloads.sh
```
Generate the workloads. This will generate both random integer keys and string ycsb keys with the specified key distribution.
```
$ cd ./index-microbench/
$ mkdir workloads
$ bash generate_all_workloads.sh
```
### Checklists
#### Configuration for workload size.
Change `LOAD_SIZE` and `RUN_SIZE` variables to be same with the generated workload size, which are hard-coded in `ycsb.cpp` (Default is 64000000).
```
$ vi ycsb.cpp
```
### Configurations for Persistent Memory 

For running the indexes on Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory, we will use 
[libvmmalloc](http://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.3/libvmmalloc.3.html) to 
transparently converts all dynamic memory allocations into Persistent Memory 
allocations, mapped by pmem. 

#### Ext4-DAX mount
```
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 -b 4096 -E stride=512 -F /dev/pmem0
$ sudo mount -o dax /dev/pmem0 /mnt/pmem
```
#### Install [PMDK](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk)
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/pmem/pmdk.git
$ cd pmdk
$ git checkout tags/1.6
$ make -j
$ cd ..
</pre>
#### Configuration for [libvmmalloc](http://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.3/libvmmalloc.3.html)
- LD_PRELOAD=path

Specifies a path to libvmmalloc.so.1. The default indicates the path to libvmmalloc.so.1 that is built from the instructions installing PMDK above.

- VMMALLOC_POOR_DIR=path

Specifies a path to the directory where the memory pool file should be created. The directory must exist and be writable.

- VMMALLOC_POOL_SIZE=len

Defines the desired size (in bytes) of the memory pool file.
```
$ vi ./scripts/set_vmmalloc.sh

Please change below configurations to fit for your environment.

export VMMALLOC_POOL_SIZE=$((64*1024*1024*1024))
export VMMALLOC_POOL_DIR="/mnt/pmem"
```

## Artifact Evaluation

For artifact evaluation, we will evaluate again the performance of the index structures presented in the paper by using YCSB benchmark. The index structures tested for artifact evaluation include `P-CLHT` `P-ART`, `P-HOT`, `P-Masstree`, `P-Bwtree`, `FAST&FAIR`, `WOART`, `CCEH`, and `Level hashing`. The evaluation results will be stored in `./results` directory as csv files. Please make sure to check the contents at least by `checklists` subsection in [Benchmark details](https://github.com/utsaslab/RECIPE#benchmark-details) section below, before beginning artifact evaluation. Note that the evaluations re-generated for artifact evaluation will be based on DRAM because Optane DC persistent memory machine used for the evaluations presented in the paper has the hard access limitation from external users. For more detail, please refer to [experiments.md](https://github.com/utsaslab/RECIPE/blob/master/experiments.md).

**RECIPE** has been awarded three badges: **Artifact Available**, **Artifact Functional**, and **Results Reproduced**.
